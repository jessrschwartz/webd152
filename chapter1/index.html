    <title>JESSICA SCHWARTZ, WEBD152 Spring Semester 2025, Chapter 1 Assignment</title>
</head>
<body>
 <p>Hi there! To say that I am excited to be taking this class, and, more specifically, that you are reading this right now, is an understatement! </p>
<p>This assignment definitely challenged me, but I think it is due to my not ever using platforms to mess and edit code before. I went down a wormhole of youtube videos, downloaded a bunch of things, restarted my computer a few times, and we finally got to the point where our class tutorials were making sense! Yay!</p>
<p>It's hard to choose just one favourite drink, so I will try and list a few:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Coca Cola (<i>not Diet Coke, not Coke Zero, not Cherry Coke -- Classic, regular, Coca Cola</i>)</i></li>
    <li>Coffee (<i>preferably iced -- anything seasonal, definitely pistachio</i>)</li>
    <li>Grape Juice (<i>but if it's not Kedem I don't want it</i>)</li>
    <li>Chocolate milkshakes (<i>'nuff said</i>)</li>
    <li>Red wine (<i>I'm a Malbec girly</i>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted to take a moment to thank you to offer additional help to me when I was struggling with my set up. I really appreciate that. I hope that now my wheels are securely on the tracks to do some really cool stuff in this class!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
